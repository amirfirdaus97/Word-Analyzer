Step to develop A Word Analyzer:

 1.We will use the function of super() to  reference variable that is used to refer parent class constructors.
 2.We need to initialize  which are string,CountVowel,CountConson,NoOfCharacter,Words.
 3.Create the title ‘ A Word Analyzer’  and text input for the user to put the word in the box.
 4.Create a button and the function of button will analyse the word that user insert at the box. 
 5.For function CountVowel and CountConson ,we need  to set 0, so when the user enter new word it will reset to zero.
6.For the function Words,the user will enter the word and using split function, it will split the word into vowel and consonant by using the loop.It will add 1 if vowel word and for the consonant it will add count 1. 
 7.For the function join, it will combine the word from function Words. 
 8.we will create the text input that can display all the output that we need which are word, no of consonants ,no of vowels and no of characters. 
 9.the user can used the word analyser by type the word they need and click the button analyze to get the result.
